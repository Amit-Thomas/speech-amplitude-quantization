# speech-amplitude-quantization
A short tutorial on the perceptual impact of varying degrees of quantization on the quality of speech and the corresponding effect on the spectrogram.

# Runbook
Running the python file requires python 3.x.x and the following libraries on your local system:
1. scipy
2. IPython
3. matplotlib

The matter has been presented in the form of a python notebook file. In order to run the file locally, download the "Speech Amplitude Quantization" folder, change directory to said folder, open the python notebook called "Speech_Amplitude_Quantization.ipynb" and run all cells to generate the results.
